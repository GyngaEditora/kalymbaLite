# Kalymba Lite

This is a smaller and more portable version of the Kalymba system. It is less fancier and has less functions but it works for quicker games or if you just need the basics.

In other words, this system will need some extra effort from the Players and the Gri√¥.

This system is also not dependant of any modules for it.

The sheet is completely in portuguese it is yet to be localized.
